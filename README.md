# About Project
In the project, a Smurfs game was designed, in which a player and a computer play. Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm was used at the point where the computer tried to catch the player.

# What is Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm?
Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes.
